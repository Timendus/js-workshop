# Webpack demo

To run locally for development (starts web server on port 9000):

```
$ npm run dev
```

To build a production version of your code:

```
$ npm run build
```

This transpiles `./index.js` to `./docs/index.js`. The `docs` directory can then
be used as the root for
[Github Pages hosting](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
